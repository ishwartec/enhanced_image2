### Enhanced Image2 Plugin for Ckeditor

This repository is meant to provide an Image2 Plugin repository on GitHub.

This is a plugin that will add some more features/fields which are not available in image2 plugin of *CKEDITOR*

Ckeditor current image2 plugin only provide fields as Url, Alt, Width, Height, Alignment and Caption image. [Image2 Plugin](http://ckeditor.com/addon/image2).


I have used image2 plugin to add our custom fields like margin, padding and Class Dropdown as per requirement.Fields that have been added once you add this module which are given as follows.

1. *Margin Top*
2. *Margin left*
3. *Margin Right*
4. *Margin Bottom*
5. *Padding Top*
6. *Padding left*
7. *Padding Right*
8. *Padding Bottom*
9. *Class (Default,Left,Right)*

All fields are optional, after setup of this module with ckeditor, you need to click on image icon to upload image, once you clock on image icon a image2 popup will be displayed and will show above mentioned fields.Once you fill the form as desired, CSS will be reflected on selected dom element.Even if you apply a class it will also add the class on selected *DOM*
